## Demo
There are several ways of customizing postcards.

I. Video 
This case proposes the recognizing postcard using a camera within a smartphone and augments the video of the sender fit to the card size. The proposed system consists of two parts, the video management module and the augmented reality module. The video management module manages playable videos and makes ID as a link between the video and the card. The augmented reality module recognizes the postcard or the picture card using the trained data which is mentioned above and estimates ID of the card and also its three-dimensional position. The ID is sent to the video management module to get the video according to the ID of the card. After that, the augmented reality module synthesizes the video to the three-dimensional position of the card. As a result, the sender shows the video to the receiver fit to the card. The process is performed in real-time.

II. Interactive 3D model
Using freely accessible (we can potentially send 3D models to the users to be placed on the cards). 


III. Automatic video from a 2D picture generation
